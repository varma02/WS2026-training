# Test Project Outline – Module A – Static Website Design

## Introduction

This project will focus on the creation of a static website using HTML and CSS only. You are asked to create a static website for a specified client.
The website will consist of subpages which should be reachable under separate paths.

The website has to conform with accessibility standards (WCAG) and implement SEO best practices,
as it will be used to attract new users for a product of the client.

Responsiveness is also important and the website should look good on three different viewports:
mobile, tablet, and desktop.

The client will supply you with a defined website structure and will therein define all
the pages and sections of the website. The client will also provide all content for the website,
such as text, images, and other media, as well as the exact definitions of the
responsive breakpoints.

## General Description of Project and Tasks

The website must consist of four different pages which will be explained in detail in this sections.
The design of all subpages should be aligned.

Within the media files, the client provided some media, icons, and text.
You are free to use them or create custom assets on your own.

As the website will be publicly available, it is important to the client that the website conforms to accessibility standards (WCAG) and implements SEO best practices.

The website must be responsive and support at least the following viewports:

- Mobile: 360x640
- Tablet: 768x1024
- Desktop: 1920x1080

No server-side or client-side framework is allowed for this project.
CSS preprocessors may be used, but the generated code must still pass the W3C validations.
All HTML and CSS code must pass the W3C validations, even generated one.

## Requirements

The goal of the website is to promote a suite of AI driven APIs.
Potential customers must be able to inform themselves about the possibilities of those APIs, the pricing, and the team behind this product.

You can add more information and elements to all pages as you see fit.
It's also possible to add links that point towards pages that do not exist yet (for example to a login page).

For each page, some example text and more are provided in the media files.
However, not all the provided material has to be used.

The following pages must be implemented.

### Home Page

A short but catching home page.
The idea is to show the product with some simple information and engaging media.
It must contain links to the product and pricing pages where interested visitors can find more information.

### Product Page

The product page shows the whole AI API suite, by listing all available APIs and their features.

### Pricing Page

On the pricing page, the pricing of the APIs must be explained.

### Team Page

As the client is also looking to grow their team, a dedicated team page must show the current employees and also highlight some core values of the company.

### Global Elements

The following elements must be available on all pages:

- **Header**: must at least include a product name in form of text or a logo
- **Navigation**: contains easily accessible links to all pages
- **Footer**: includes at least a copyright notice

All elements can be enriched with more information where it makes sense.

## Assessment

The project will be assessed using Google Chrome and Firefox.
The axe browser extension is installed in Google Chrome and allows competitors to validate the website according to the accessibility standards WCAG.

## Mark distribution

The table below outlines how marks are broken down and how they align with the WorldSkills
Occupation Standards (WSOS). Please read the Technical Description for a full explanation of the
